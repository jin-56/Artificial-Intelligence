**Artificial Intelligence Projects**

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence Projects** repository.
This repository contains a collection of AI projects showcasing Streamlit apps, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tools, and Agentic AI systems are designed for learning and experimentation.


## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebooks are used for data exploration, preprocessing, and training machine learning models such as Iris detection and sentiment analysis. Each notebook documents the development process step by step.

- `streamlit_app/`  
  Interactive web applications are built with Streamlit to demonstrate AI models in real time. They include user-friendly interfaces for classification and prediction tasks.

- `rag_tool/`  
  Using Groqcloud, SerpAPI, Pinecone, and Google Gemini, an RAG app was visualized through the Streamlit feature. The project done is to retrieve relevant documents and generate answers using language models.

- `agentic_ai/`  
  In Agentic AI, the learning of the basic implementation of the pre-existing models such as "llama3-70b-8192", "llama3-13b-4096", "gemma-7b-it", "qwen-qwen1.5-32b" are used to check the models responses to the provided prompt.
  
- `ML_models/`
  This repository contains the Machine Learning models used, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
  

## üìù Some of the Projects

### Iris Flower Detection Web App trained by SVM

A beginner-friendly machine learning project built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.  
- Trains a classifier to predict Iris species based on flower measurements and shows the picture of the flower predicted.  
- The trained model is saved with pickle and used in the Streamlit app for live predictions.

### Sentiment Analysis Web App using Naive Bayes

A simple NLP project that classifies text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.  
- Model training performed in a Jupyter notebook.  
- Uses Scikit-learn, NLTK for text processing, and Streamlit for the interface.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Tool

It combines document retrieval methods with generative language models for improved question answering.  
- Firstly, the PDF files are provided and used prompt engineeringo provide prompt for the LLM models so they can predict more knowledge base answer.  
- Utilizes retrievers and generators in a pipeline.

### Agentic AI Systems

Exploring the Agentic AI features.  
- Designed a chatbot using the Agentic AI model.


**Usage Tips**

Explore notebooks first to understand model training.
